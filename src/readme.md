Continuation vue101. Includes following:
- routing,
- some style changing,
- binding,
- mixins and filters

Some given extra tasks I had to sort on my own. Last prep before he my own project.
Basic stuff, however seems it will keep me going.

Really enjoying it and thing Vue is great tool to have behind the belt.
